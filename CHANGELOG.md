# Changelog

All notable changes to Orchvia are recorded here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); before 1.0, a minor version may change the API.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `close({mode:'interrupt'})` now waits for interrupted turns, at most `timeouts.interruptMs` and half of `timeoutMs`, before it closes the adapters. A Claude turn that reports its interruption in that time is paused with reason `runtime_interrupted`, as documented, instead of ending `outcome_unknown` and quarantined. The cleanup after a stdio host's owner disconnects still closes the adapters at once (SPEC-0022 C).

### Added

- A task dispatched again after a failed check sees the failed rule's command, exit status and the end of its output, and `verification.completed` summarizes every rule that ran (SPEC-0022 V).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

First public release, on npm as `@orchvia/*` and on PyPI as `orchvia`.

### Added

- One local engine for Node.js 22.18 and later. SQLite stores tasks, sessions, messages, approvals, events and usage records.
- A TypeScript SDK (`@orchvia/sdk`) and a Python SDK (`orchvia`) with the same API, over an in-process engine, a child process or a Unix socket.
- Runtime adapters for Claude Code (`@orchvia/adapter-claude`) and Codex (`@orchvia/adapter-codex`), and a host with commands (`@orchvia/cli`).
- Sessions that stay warm across tasks: reuse, fork (also to another model of the same provider), compaction, pause, resume and stop.
- Scheduling with dependencies, queues, capacity limits and exclusive write scopes; acceptance by a person or by registered checks; approval of delegations and handoffs; token records per task.
- An optional routing layer with pluggable judges, and `context.checkRefs` to check context references before submitting.

### Changed

- The packages were renamed from the unpublished `@agent-orch/*` and the Python module `agent_orch`, with no aliases. Protocol identifiers did not change: the `agent_orch` MCP server name and its tool names, request digests, and the schema identifier.

Local release candidates 0.1.0-rc.1 to 0.1.0-rc.14 preceded this release; [docs/status.md](docs/status.md#candidate-builds) lists them.
